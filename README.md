# Data-Professional-Survey-Breakdown


**About this Project**

This project was developed using Microsoft Power BI to analyze a global dataset on professional roles in tech and data fields. The goal was to uncover insights about job distribution, salary trends, technology preferences, and job satisfaction levels across different countries and regions.

The data was sourced from a professional survey and visualized using interactive dashboards to enable dynamic exploration of key employment metrics globally.

**Data Preparation**

The dataset was carefully cleaned and transformed in Power BI using Power Query to ensure accuracy and consistency in analysis.

**Key preparation steps included:**

1) Removed irrelevant or incomplete responses to ensure a clean dataset.

2) Standardized country names, job titles, and programming language entries.

3) Grouped countries by regions for more meaningful geographic analysis.

4) Filtered out extreme outliers in salary to avoid skewed insights.

5) Removed duplicate responses and harmonized similar question formats.

Final dataset contained **14,576** valid responses ready for analysis.

**Key Insights**

**Profession Distribution by Region**

Most respondents were concentrated in North America, Europe, and Asia.

Data Scientists, Software Engineers, and Analysts were the top three job titles globally.

**Salary Analysis**

Average salary varied significantly by both job title and region.

Professionals in roles like Data Architects and Machine Learning Engineers had the highest average salaries.

Countries in North America and Western Europe reported higher compensation levels overall.

**Programming Language Preferences**

Python emerged as the most widely used and preferred programming language.

Other popular technologies included SQL, R, and JavaScript.

Regional preferences varied slightly, with Python leading across most countries.

**Job & Salary Satisfaction**

A majority of respondents reported being satisfied with their jobs, though satisfaction levels varied by profession.

Salary satisfaction tended to be lower than job satisfaction, especially in regions with lower pay scales.

Roles in “Executive” and “Manager” categories had higher satisfaction levels compared to “Staff” or “Entry-Level” positions.

**Conclusion**

The analysis revealed clear patterns in how professions, technologies, and satisfaction levels vary across the globe. While most professionals are satisfied with their work, there is room for improvement in salary expectations and role-based recognition.

This dashboard provides a comprehensive, interactive overview for stakeholders to explore global employment trends in the tech and data industry.

**Recommendations**

**Salary benchmarking:** Help companies adjust salaries based on regional and role-based expectations.

**Technology investment:** Training in Python and SQL can align employee skills with market trends.

**Retention strategy:** Focus on improving job satisfaction in roles with low sentiment, especially staff-level positions.

**Regional engagement:** Tailor policies and benefits to regional needs and cultural expectations.
